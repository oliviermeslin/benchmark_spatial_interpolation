# A benchmark of ensemble methods for spatial interpolation on large datasets

To produce the full benchmark, open the terminal and then :

cd benchmark_spatial_interpolation/ 
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
chmod +x benchmark.sh
./benchmark.sh

You can have a look at the report in s3 ! 


If you want to avoid to run the code which is long you can just avoid that by running  : 
cd benchmark_spatial_interpolation/ 
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
chmod +x report.sh
./report.sh
