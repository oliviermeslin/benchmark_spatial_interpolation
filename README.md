# A benchmark of ensemble methods for spatial interpolation on large datasets

To produce the benchmark, open the terminal and then :

cd benchmark_spatial_interpolation/ 
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
chmod +x benchmark.sh
./benchmark.sh

You can have a look at the report in s3 ! 

Currently to avoid to run benchmark, a example.json file has been pushed to github with a production of the benchmark and you can direclty render the quarto document.
